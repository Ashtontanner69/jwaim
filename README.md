# jwaim - csgo multi-cheat for linux
This is a cheat for the 64 bit linux csgo (tested on ubuntu 17.04)  
It utilizes QT graphics library to draw ESP and other info on screen  

I uploaded it here to share with anyone interested, and mainly just so that I don't lose track of it. I hope anyone who finds this can find it useful for learning or for fun. Â 

If you were wondering, I wrote this cheat almost entirely from scratch. I used a memory wrapper and glow read/write functionality from github user thisgamesux/s0beit.  

Development started 7/1/17
